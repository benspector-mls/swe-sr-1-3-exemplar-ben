For guidance on setting up and submitting this assignment, refer to the Marcy lab School Docs How-To guide for [Working with Short Response and Coding Assignments](https://marcylabschool.gitbook.io/marcy-lab-school-docs/fullstack-curriculum/how-tos/working-with-assignments#how-to-work-on-assignments).

## Question 1

Read the [findIndex documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex). When would you want to use `findIndex` instead of `indexOf`?

## Question 2

The callback that you provide to `forEach`, `filter`, or `map` will be invoked with three values:
1. `element` - The current element being processed in the array.
2. `index` — The index of the current element being processed in the array.
3. `array` — The array the higher order method was called upon.

For example: 

```js
let friends = ['ben', 'carmen', 'itzel', 'zo', 'gonzalo'];

friends.forEach((element, index, array) => {

});
```

What is the purpose of these callback parameters? Fill in the code above with an example of how you might use those additional callback parameters to do something useful.

## Question 3

According to our [style guide](https://marcylabschool.gitbook.io/marcy-lab-school-docs/fullstack-curriculum/cheatsheets/style-guide#iterators-and-generators) (adopted from AirBnb), it is recommended that you only use array higher-order functions like `forEach` instead of `for` loops.

What do you see as the benefit of doing this?

## Question 4

Below is a regular expression. What kinds of strings does it identify? Explain each portion of it.

```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$/
```

## Question 5
Imagine you are teaching a brand new programmer a brief lesson about callback functions. Your lesson should have the following components:
* An explanation of the concept with an analogy ("A callback function is a ... It is like a ...")
* An example of the syntax for a higher order function that accepts a callback.
* An explanation of the syntax using the terms **callback**, **higher order function**

Below, we've provided an outline for your response but feel free to modify it as you see fit.

### Response 5

Explanation of the concept with an analogy.

Check out this example:

```js
